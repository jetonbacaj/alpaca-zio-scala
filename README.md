# alpaca-zio-scala
A ZIO-powered Scala library to interface with alpaca.markets API

There are three phases to this projects;

1. Basic ordering/webhook for equity trading
2. Market data (both "free" and "paid" tiers)
3. Support for crypto trading

Inspired by https://github.com/cynance/alpaca-scala

This is a work in progress - stay tuned!
